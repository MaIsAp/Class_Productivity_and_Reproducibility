# Class_Productivity_and_Reproducibility

This is an example of a reproducible project created in the Open Science Framework ([OSF](https://osf.io/)) for the class: [Productivity and Reproducibility in Ecology and Evolution 2023W1](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/courses.html)

This project shows an example of the structure of the files that would be required for the development of a manuscript associated to a project that took place at the Caribbean cost of Colombia. This has been an opportunity to register the data management plan proposed for this project, however just part of the translated files have been made available here to serve as an example of how an initial version of this could look like, following the instructions of the class.

The folder structure is:\
├── 01-scripts\
│   ├── RMD_scripts\
│   └── r_scripts\
├── 02-outdata\
├── 03-figs\
├── 04-manuscript\
│   └── rendered\
└── renv\
   ├── library\
   │   └── R-4.3\
   │       └── x86_64-pc-linux-gnu\

The rawdata folder is not added on this project. The pre-registration folder has been added on another OSF project and the link can be found on the [wiki](https://osf.io/489wp/wiki/home/?view_only=6cef2d5f90e94f25a0e36b53ffc8d230).

The 01-scripts folder has a script used to simulate data to show an example structure here.\
